# Interactive Harmonograph 

This is an extension to the original project for 50.017 - Graphics & Visualisation course at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

This iteration integrates a "reconstruction testbed" to try out different techniques on the generated harmonograph's point cloud. 

## Instructions

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./harmonograph.exe
