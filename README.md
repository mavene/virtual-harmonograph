# Interactive Harmonograph 

This is an extension to the original project for 50.017 - Graphics & Visualisation course at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

This iteration integrates a "reconstruction testbed" to try out different techniques like Delaunay triangulation and voxel-based techniques on the harmonograph point cloud.
